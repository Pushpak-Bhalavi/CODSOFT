## 📁 Where to Place the File

Once downloaded, place the file here in your local project structure: CODSOFT/
                                                                      └── Task 3 - Credit Card Fraud Detection/
                                                                          └── Data/
                                                                              └── creditcard.csv  ← (you place the file here)

## 🚀 What to Do Next

- Start working in `fraud.ipynb` inside the same task folder
- The notebook will read the CSV from your local path
- Do **not commit** the large `.csv` file to GitHub

📌 _Note: This method keeps the repository lightweight and professional, while still linking to full data for local use._
